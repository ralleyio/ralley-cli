# Ralley Cli

[Ralley](https://ralley.io) is a managed message queue as a service. Blimey, that's a mouthful. We help you send queued messages without any setup. All you have to do is prefix your request with `ralley.to/` and we'll queue it for you!

This is the CLI for Ralley. It helps you to view requests, manage your account and has a really handy `dev` server.


### Install

Install using NPM:

```
npm install -g @ralley/cli
```

Install using script:

```bash
curl -fsSL get.ralley.io -o get-ralley.sh
sh get-ralley.sh
```

You should update Ralley by running the same command.

For additional usage commands use `-h` on sub-commands. E.g. `ralley workspaces -h`.



### Dev Server (`ralley dev`)

A local dev server that can be used during development. It implements the [same API](https://ralley.io/docs) as the `ralley.to`. By default it runs on http://localhost:4747 - you can specify an alternative port using `-p`.

So to queue a request it would be: 

```sh
curl http://localhost:4747/myurl.com?_delay=10

```

The `queue` and `requests` commands support a `--dev` flag which can be used to target your dev server instead of the Ralley servers. E.g. To list requests in your dev server use `ralley requests --dev`



#### Differences to production

There are some minor differences to the production server:

 * No token is required (any `_token` parameter will be ignored)

 * Only the the following endpoints are supported. These endpoints work in the same way as the [Ralley API](https://ralley.io/docs):

    * Queue - `http://localhost:4747/<url>` (incl all headers/query parameters)
    * Bulk - `http://localhost:4747/bulk`
    * List requests - `http://localhost:4747/requests`
    * Get a single request - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>`
    * Pause request - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>/inactive`
    * Unpause request - `http://localhost:4747/requests/<id>/active`
